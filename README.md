# OSCP Cheat Sheets

## DISCLAIMER

These cheat sheets were written in preparation for an OSCP exam that was taken in 2021 (i.e., before the exam went through major changes including an added AD set of machines).

Cheat sheets:
- [Linux Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/mr-b4rt0wsk1/oscp_cheat_sheets/blob/main/nix_priv_esc.md)
- [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://github.com/mr-b4rt0wsk1/oscp_cheat_sheets/blob/main/win_priv_esc.md)
- [Windows Buffer Overflow Methodology](https://github.com/mr-b4rt0wsk1/oscp_cheat_sheets/blob/main/win_bof.md)
- [Reverse Shells](https://github.com/mr-b4rt0wsk1/oscp_cheat_sheets/blob/main/rev_shells.md)
- [Shell Upgrade](https://github.com/mr-b4rt0wsk1/oscp_cheat_sheets/blob/main/shell_upgrade.md)

## Future additions

- If I find the time, I may retroactively add an initial recon and enumeration cheat sheet. Overall, my methodology mainly included running [AutoRecon](https://github.com/Tib3rius/AutoRecon) and looking up specific ports in [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/index.html) if I needed additional help with any open ports that were found.
